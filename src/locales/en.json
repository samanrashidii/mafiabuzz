At <span class='night-color'>Night</span>, certain players secretly perform special actions; during <span class='day-color'>Day</span>, players discuss and vote to kill one player. These phases alternate with each other until all mafioso have been eliminated or until the mafia outnumbers the citizens. <br /> Some players may be given roles with special abilities (Chosen by <span class='creator-color'>Game Creator</span>) <br /><br /> <span class='night-color'>Night:</span> All players close their eyes.

Discussion ensues among the living players. At any point, a player may accuse someone of being a mafioso and prompt others to vote to kill them. If over half of the players do so, the accused person is eliminated and <span class='night-color'>Night</span> begins. Otherwise, thos phase continues until a killing occurs. Dead players are not permitted to attempt to influence the remainder of the game.
